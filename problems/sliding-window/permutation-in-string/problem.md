Write the problem statement here in Markdown.

You are given two strings s1 and s2.

Return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise. That means if a permutation of s1 exists as a substring of s2, then return true.

Both strings only contain lowercase letters.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "lecabee"

Output: true
Explanation: The substring "cab" is a permutation of "abc" and is present in "lecabee".

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "lecaabee"

Output: false
