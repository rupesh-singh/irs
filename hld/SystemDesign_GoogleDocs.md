# System Design: Google Docs (Collaborative Editor)

## Goals
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Low latency typing experience
- Conflict resolution and consistency

## High-level Architecture
```
Client (Web)  <->  Realtime Gateway  <->  Collaboration Service  <->  Storage
```
- Realtime Gateway: WebSocket fan-out, auth, room management
- Collaboration Service: Operational Transform or CRDT engine
- Storage: Document snapshots + operation logs

## Key Components
- OT/CRDT Engine: merges concurrent edits
- Presence Service: cursors, selections
- Snapshotter: periodic compaction
- CDN: static assets

## Considerations
- Sharding by document ID
- Backpressure & batching
- Security: ACLs, sharing links
